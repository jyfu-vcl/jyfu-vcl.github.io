I'm a second year M.Sc student from [School of Electronic and Computer Engineering](https://www.ece.pku.edu.cn/en/About/Welcome_to_SECE.htm), [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn/). 

I am very fortunate to be co-supervised by [Prof. Siwei Ma](https://cs.pku.edu.cn/info/1236/2106.htm) of [Video Coding Lab](https://idm.pku.edu.cn/en/info/1012/1030.htm) from School of Computer Science, Peking University and [Prof. Jian Zhang](https://jianzhang.tech/) of [VILLA lab](https://villa.jianzhang.tech/) from School of Electronic and Computer Engineering, Peking University. I obtained my Bachelor degree in 2024 from Beijing University of Technology, working with [Prof. Jin Wang](https://english.bjut.edu.cn/info/1335/5055.htm).

My research centers on two closely connected directions.

1. **Next-generation video coding standards.** I work on advancing the technologies behind future video coding standards to make this process more efficient. Several of my proposals have been adopted by [Joint Video Experts Team (JVET)](https://jvet-experts.org/) and [Audio Video coding Standard (AVS)](https://www.avs.org.cn/en/). My research in this area mainly focuses on improving *intra prediction*, *loop filtering*, and *CNN-based prediction tools*, with the goal of achieving better rate–distortion performance under reasonable complexity.

2. **3D generation and reconstruction.** As we move toward immersive and interactive media, 3D content will become the next form of information representation. My current work targets high-quality, high-efficiency *3D reconstruction* and *3D generative techniques* for real-world scenes and objects, aiming to bridge the gap between 2D video/image compression and 3D-aware visual communication.
